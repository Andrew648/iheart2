<string name="Repent"><![CDATA[<b>The Starting Point of John’s Gospel</b><br><br>
John the Baptist was the forerunner of Jesus. He was Jesus’ cousin, born 6 months earlier than Jesus, and was from birth bestowed the ministry of introducing Jesus to the world, preparing the people to receive Jesus’ ministry. The Bible in <a href="41_1_1-8">Mark 1:1-8</a> describes John’s ministry using the following words: He was God’s messenger sent before Jesus to prepare the way for Jesus. He came to baptise in the wilderness and preach a baptism of <b><i>repentance</i></b> for the remission (or complete cancellation and forgiveness) of sins. <a href="40_3_2">Matthew 3:2</a> records John preaching “<b><i>Repent</i></b> for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!” <br><br>
<b>The Starting Point of Jesus’ Gospel</b><br><br>
Then when Jesus began his ministry, His message had similar introductory words too! For example, <a href="40_4_7">Matthew 4:7</a> records that “From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” Also in <a href="41_1_15">Mark 1:15</a> Jesus preached “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel.”<br><br>
<b>Meaning of Repent</b><br>
As a new Christian believer it is vital to “repent”. What is the meaning of “to repent”, what is “repentance”? The various definitions are:<br>
&#8226;Dictionary defines repentance as “the action of repenting, sincere regret, sincere remorse.” <br>
&#8226;Cambridge English Dictionary defines repentance as “to be very sorry for something bad you have done in the past and wish that you had not done it”<br>
&#8226;The Greek word for repent is the verb “metanoeo” (metanoevw) and the noun “metanoia” (metavnoia), and reference to “repent” and “repentance” occur about 54 times in the New Testament. The 2 usual senses are “a change of mind” and “regret or remorse”.<br>
&#8226;In the Old Testament, the references to “repent” is to “turn” or “return”, “to turn away from evil, and to turn to the good”. <br><br>
John’s message to the people was one of “turning away from sin” and breaking away from the old and turning to God. John went further to require the people to be baptised in water for repentance (<a href="41_1_4">Mark 1:4</a>,<a href="42_3_3">Luke 3:3</a>) and afterwards show “fruits of repentance” (<a href="42_3_10-14">Luke 3:10-14</a>) by the changed attitudes hearts and deeds.<br><br>
Some examples from the Bible of people who repented are as follows: <br><br>
1.	John gave specific ways of how people could show the fruits, or practical consequences, of their repentance. In <a href="42_3_10-14">Luke 3:10-14</a> he taught that <br>
a.	People (everyone) who had more than what they needed should share their possession and provision with those who did not have, “give to the hungry, clothe the poor, bless the needy”. <br>
b.	Workers (tax collectors) ought to do the right thing and not exploit their position of power to acquire more for themselves at the expense of other, “be honest”. <br>
c.	government employees (soldiers) ought to be content with one’s wages and not use their position of power to intimidate exploit or extort for the purpose of personal gain, also not accuse falsely, intimidate or terrify others by threats of violence, not accuse the innocent, for the objective of gaining an advantage over others in their care. <br>
2.	Jesus taught the story of the prodigal son in <a href="40_21_29">Matthew 21:29</a> and how the son “changed his mind” about doing his father’s bidding. <br>
3.	In <a href="40_27_3">Matthew 27:3</a>, Judas Iscariot was “seized with remorse” after betraying Jesus. <br>
4.	Paul in <a href="47_7_8-10">2 Corinthians 7:8-10</a> said he did not regret the sorrow caused to his readers by his letters, and did not regret the pain that brought “repentance” that leads to salvation. <br><br>
<b>Why Repent? </b><br><br>
When people make a conscious decision to believe in Jesus, believe in the gospel (story) of Jesus, desire to commence a relationship with Almighty God and follow His ways, the Bible says that people are suddenly translated from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light. The kingdom of light is God’s kingdom. The kingdom of darkness comprises everything worldly, carnal, demonic. This realm of living comprises values and principles that are contrary to the realm of living in God’s kingdom. One must accept the truth that that cannot be any mixture or compromise between the 2 kingdoms. In other words, it is not possible or practical for one to have 1 foot in the kingdom of darkness and 1 foot in the kingdom of light. If this is the case, then the writer would venture to say that such a person is more likely to be living out of the kingdom of darkness, but trying to live in the kingdom of light, and this person will end up confused, frustrated, disillusioned, or a weak Christian. <br><br>
Having lived in the kingdom of darkness for a long while, and then suddenly coming into the kingdom of light, it is vital for one to be willing to start on a clean slate, to ‘start from scratch’ so to speak. It is vital for one to be willing to understand God’s kingdom, His ways, His will, His rules, and to start living accordingly to God’s kingdom economy, and therefore ‘repentance’ or a change of one’s heart mind attitude direction and life’s destiny is necessary. <br><br>
Jesus taught that one cannot add new wine into old wineskins. The new wine will cause the old wineskins to tear and break, and finally both the new wine and old wineskins will be lost. However, new wine (new teachings, new ways) must be put into new wineskins (repented people). <br><br>
People who try to live as Christians but without having first repented, will face great difficulty in accepting the ways and will of God. Some Christians can attend church meetings and services for many years and still find it difficult to breakthrough into an experience of victory, peace, and miracles. Repentant at the ‘get go’ is the key. <br><br>
<b>Repent From What? </b> <br><br>
Repent from <br>
&#8226;Lack of faith, lack of belief => dare to believe, pray and ask God to help our unbelief <a href="41_9_24">Mark 9:24</a>, <a href="58_10_38">Hebrews 10:38</a><br>
&#8226;Stubborn, stiff-necked <a href="43_7_51_">Acts 7:51</a> => be humble, be responsive to God’s call, instructions, commands, specific directive words<br>
&#8226;Disobedience <a href="49_2_2">Ephesians 2:2</a> => obedient, teachable, good learner, good student <br>
&#8226;Evil ways, evil deeds, evil intentions => motive and conduct are to be radically changed to become godly and reflective of God’s will and God’s ways <a href="Isa1_16_17">Isaiah 1:16-17</a>, <a href="26_14_6">Ezekiel 14:6</a>, <a href="26_18_30">18:30</a>, <a href="26_33_11"> 33:11</a><br>
&#8226;Futile mind <a href="49_4_17">Ephesians 4:17</a> => renewed mind according to God’s will and God’s word, transformed life with good deeds pleasing to the Lord <a href="45_12_1-2">Romans 12:1-2</a><br><br>

<b>How to Repent</b><br><br>
1.	Confession of sins <a href="62_1_9">1 John 1:9</a>, <a href="3_5_5"> Leviticus 5:5</a>, <a href="3_26_40-42">26:40-42</a>, <a href="14_7_14">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>, <a href="https://www.biblesociety.org.uk/explore-the-bible/read/eng/GNB/Ps/25/">Psalm 25</a>, <a href="https://www.biblesociety.org.uk/explore-the-bible/read/eng/GNB/Ps/51/">Psalm 51</a> => repentance and God’s forgiveness, healing<br>
2.	Stop the walk of old (futile mind, darkened understanding, separated from life of God, ignorant, blind heart, devoid of feeling, given to sinful and greedy ways, given to doing unclean work) <a href="49_4_17-19">Ephesians 4:17-19</a>, <a href="46_5_17">1 Corinthians 5:17</a><br>
3.	Learn Christ, experience Jesus <a href="49_20-21">Ephesians 4:20-21</a><br>
4.	Put off the old man, the former conduct, sinful and deceitful desires => put on the new man, the new creation (born again by God’s Spirit according to God, in true righteousness and true holiness) <a href="49_5_22-5_21">Ephesians 4:22-5:21</a><br>
5.	Be renewed in attitude, in mind <a href="45_12_1-2">Romans 12:1-2</a><br>
6.	Ask God to help in all things. The Holy Spirit lives in you and is with you ready to help you to live life according to God’s will and God’s ways, and with God’s power and divine ability <a href="44_14_15-18">John 14:15-18</a>, <a href="43_15_26">15:26</a>, <a href="62_2_20-27">1 John 2:20-27</a><br>

<b>Fruits of Repentance</b><br><br>
When one repents and starts to walk out a repentant life, living with a repentant mind, heart, will, one will immediately start to bear fruits of repentance that John the Baptist spoke about in <a href="40_3_8">Matthew 3:8</a>. <br><br>
<font color="#ff0000">Practical</font><br><br>
This is a suggested prayer to God for repentance: <br>
Dear Heavenly Father, I come to you in the Name of Jesus Christ my Lord and Saviour. I acknowledge that I am wrong / ignorant / gone my own way / done my own thing, which is contrary to You and Your will and Your ways. I am sorry. I ask for your forgiveness and to cleanse me with the blood of Jesus. <br>
Thank You for accepting me in the Beloved. Thank You that there is no condemnation because I am in Christ. You are My Father, and I am Your child. I ask for your help, because I want to start living according to Your will and Your Word from now on. I want to repent and bear fruits worthy of repentance. So by the power of Your Holy Spirit, lead me and guide me. Speak to me and show me from Your Word, what I must do to change my mind and my way of life. Thank you. Amen. <br>

<string name="Follow_Jesus"><![CDATA[<b><font size="6">Introduction – Jesus’ Call to “Follow Me”</font></b><br>
It was God’s plan from the beginning to send Jesus to the earth, even though He was (and is) God, yet to live as a man, and to die on the cross for our sin as the lamb sacrifice. Jesus’ blood washes us of all our sin. <a href="66_13_8">Revelation 13:8 </a> declares that Jesus is the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. Therefore, Jesus had a plan to execute and an objective to accomplish. His life on earth was intentional and full of purpose. <br><br>

Even though Jesus’ ministry lasted a short 3.5 years, part of His plan included calling and making disciples.<br><br>
At the beginning of His ministry, <a href="40_4_18-22">Matthew 4:18-22 </a>recorded how Jesus called his first 4 disciples, who were businessman running a “fishing” business. He saw 2 brothers Simon Peter and Andrew and said to them, “Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.” They immediately left their nets and followed Him. He saw another 2 brothers James and John and called them, and immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him. <br>
The observation is as follows: <br>
	 &#10004;Jesus called the men, saying “Follow Me”. <br>
	 &#10004;Jesus gave them His (new) vision and mission being “I will make you fishermen of people” (as opposed to fish). <br>
	 &#10004;Their response was immediate, and they each left their current work and family, and followed Jesus into the new vision and mission that He told them about. <br><br>
Their response tells me that they believed in Jesus and His vision and mission for them; they were confident in His Word, they did not doubt! <br><br>

<b>Meaning of “Follow”</b><br>
Google dictionary says “go or come after a person proceeding ahead; move or travel behind.” <br><br>

Cambridge English dictionary says “to move behind someone and go where he goes.” <br><br>

Essentially, Jesus gave an invitation to the 4 men to leave their then current way of life, and to ‘follow’ Him, to be with Him, to spend their daily lifetime with Him. It is throughout the day and during this time of togetherness that the 4 men can observe Jesus, watch His ways, learn His values, have many conversations and discussions about life and all of life’s contents. It is also out of this constant close association and fellowship that Jesus can teach these 4 men, correct, counsel, explain God’s ways and God’s will. <br>

This effectively is the process of ‘making disciples’; it is a lifestyle process, it is a close association and learning journey of the disciple maker and disciple, walking out life together. The disciple maker moulding and shaping the disciple according to the image and likeness and pattern of God <a href="1_1_28">Genesis 1:28</a>, <a href="23_64_8">Isaiah 64:8</a>, <a href="47_3_18">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>. <br>
Therefore Jesus was the disciple maker (or discipler) and He made disciples out of the men who followed Him. <br>

<b>God has Given the Call to You to “Follow Him” </b><br>
<a href="55_1_9">2 Timothy 1:9 </a > says that God “has saved us and called us with a holy calling, according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began”. This scripture clearly tells us that God has called us according to His purpose. Just like Jesus called His disciples for a purpose. Do you know what is that purpose? <br><br>
<a href="66_17_14">Revelation 17:14</a> says “those who are with Him are called, chosen, and faithful”. Those who follow Jesus are indeed “with Him”. Who would give up the opportunity to be with Jesus? <br>
God’s call is to everyone to follow Him, to leave behind the former way of life, the former way of thinking, the former conduct, even the former way of conducting business, and to follow Him. Follow His way of life, His way of thinking, His conduct, His way of conducting business. <br><br>

Did you know that even though God’s call has been given to everyone, not everyone will respond?! Not everyone will follow Him! Jesus said that many are called, but few are chosen <a href="40_20_16">Matthew 20:16</a>, <a href="40_22_14">22:14</a>. This does not mean that God only chooses a few. It properly means that few respond to God’s call. Also, of the ones that respond to God’s call, some will drop off because of various reasons. For example, Jesus called the rich young ruler to “come, follow Me” but he “went away sorrowful” and did not follow Jesus<a href="40_19_16-22"> Matthew 19:16-22</a>. <br><br>

These are some of the reasons that people fail to follow Jesus, or to remain faithful to the end in the following of Jesus: <br>

&#8226;In the case of the rich young ruler, he had great possessions and could not make the decision to sell everything that he had and give it to the poor, and that inability stopped him from following Jesus <a href="40_19_21-22">Matthew 19:21-22</a>. For this chap, he could not repent; he could not let go of his material wealth, he could not leave behind all his possessions, and these material things prevented him from following Jesus. <br>

&#8226;Some other reasons could be<a href="42_8_4-15"> Luke 8:4-15</a><br>
	&#8212;demonic influence (seed that fall by the wayside)<br>
	o	temptation causes one to fall away, because lacking good deep roots in the things of God (seed that fall on rock)<br>
	o	life’s cares, riches, pleasures choke the life of God and therefore no fruit and no maturity (seed that fall among thorns)<br><br>
<b>Passing the Baton</b><br>
We know that Jesus called his disciples to follow Him. Did you also know that Jesus has called you (and me) to send the call out to others (all kinds and all types, from all parts of the world) to follow us <a href="40_28_18-20"> Matthew 28:18-20</a>, <a href="43_20_21">John 20:21</a>? <br><br>
Jesus called 4 men to “Follow Him” => 4 men became His disciples => 4 men to go make disciples of all nations<br><br>

<b>Jesus’ Example</b><br>
Jesus taught His disciples to follow Him. He taught the disciples and the multitudes through different ways, such as in parables, using life issues, addressed money and finance. He served people, He healed the sick, He prayed, He did many miracles. These are some aspects of Jesus’ life, as an example for us to follow:<br>
a.	Jesus was obedient to His Father – He only did what He saw His Father doing <a href="43_5_30">John 5:30</a>, <a href="43_8_28">8:28</a>, <a href="43_10_18">10:18</a>, <a href="43_10_25">25</a> <br>
b.	Jesus prayed<br>
c.	Jesus relied on the Word of God for His sustenance and to overcome evil <a href="40_4_4">Matthew 4:4</a><br>
d.	Looked after His family (biological and spiritual) <br>
e.	Jesus mixed around with all types and all kinds of people (cf not only people who He preferred) <br>
f.	Considered the needs of people, strangers<br>
g.	Paid His taxes properly<br>
h.	Did not condone or put up with religious practices, which He considered to be hypocritical and deceitful<br>
i.	Desired unity, love, peace<br>
a.	Performed miracles signs and wonders (we must learn to live out the power of God in and through our lives daily<a href="43_14_12"> John 14:12</a>, <a href="41_16_17-18_20"> Mark 16:17-18, 20</a>) <br><br>
We must decide once and for all, will be respond immediately to God’s call upon our lives, to follow Him, or not. The decision must be firm, definite, permanent. The decision cannot be wishy washy, half-hearted, compromised, weak, indefinite, short-term. Some people will say ‘yes’ but mean ‘no’ in their minds and hearts. In order for anyone to properly follow Jesus, the decision must be to “repent” from the former things, and start on a new course, a new direction, a new way of life. There must be a change of heart and mind, there must be a letting go and putting off of the past. There cannot be a turning back or regret once one moves forward into the new way of life and living in Christ. <br> <br>

<b>Who Are You Following? </b><br><br>
It is important for you (and me) to ask these questions of ourselves. It is necessary to take some time to self-examine. Am I following Jesus? Am I a follower of Jesus? Is my life patterned after Jesus’ life? Are my values principles and convictions the same as that of Jesus? Do I search the Word of God to obey God’s commands and instructions? <br><br>
Am I following the world’s ways? Do I fashion myself after what I see and hear on screens (movies, internet, online chat applications)? Have I made the values of media become my values (drama series, journalists who report the news with their versions and views)? Do I follow well known personalities (politicians, movie actors, singers, dancers, performers)? <br>
Jesus left earth a little over 2,000 years ago and returned to His heavenly abode <a href="41_16_19">Mark 16:19</a>, <a href="42_24_51">Luke 24:51</a>. He commissioned His disciples to continue going about making disciples. Therefore today, we “follow Jesus” by following these: <br><br>
1.	The Word of God both Old and New Testaments as this is the will of God comprised and preserved for our knowledge observance and life. The Word of God is our manual of the life in Christ. There is so much treasure and truth in God’s Word. There is life and light and power in God’s written promises. We must search the Scriptures with a hungry and thirsty attitude to find the truth that will help us to live out this godly Christian life with success and fulfilment. <br>
2.	Jesus’ life as recorded in the books of the Bible written by His disciples Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. <br>
3.	Church community – elders, pastors, brothers and sisters who fellowship and encourage one another. It is vital for a Christian to find a church community that is good and conducive for growth unto maturity. <br><br>
<font color="#ff0000">Practical - Prayer</font><br>
Practical steps include making a commitment to attend church meetings where the Word of God is preached and taught for the objective of helping you become a mature son or daughter of God. <br>
Suggested Prayer is as follows: <br>
Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for calling me to follow Jesus. Right now, I decide to “Follow Jesus”, to obey Your Word, to stay in fellowship with brothers and sisters who together we can grow unto maturity. Help me to be a good disciple. Help me to learn Your Word, and Your Will, and Your ways. In time, help me to go and make disciples. In Jesus’ Name I ask. Amen.

<string name="Disciples_Self_and_Cross"><![CDATA[<b><font size="6">To Follow Jesus – Jesus’ Criteria”</font></b><br><br>
Jesus made clear to His disciples what His criteria was for them to become His disciples: <br>
&#8226;<a href="40_16_24">Matthew 16:24 </a> “If anyone desires to come after Me, <b>let him deny himself</b>, and <b>take up his cross</b>, and <b>follow Me </b><br>
&#8226;<a href="41_8_34">Mark 8:34 </a> “Whoever desires to come after Me, <b>let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. </b><br>
&#8226;<a href="41_10_21">Mark 10:21</a>  to the rich young ruler, with a heart full of love for him: “Go your way, sell whatever you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, <b>take up the cross, and follow Me.” </b><br>
&#8226;<a href="42_9_23">Luke 9:23 </a> “If anyone desires to come after Me,<b> let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me.” </b><br><br>
These scriptures were originally written in Greek and in translation, depending on what message the translator perceives the original Greek word (or writer) is attempting to convey, various English words can be used. Therefore, from the use of 3 Bible versions (New King James Version, The Passion Translation, and Amplified Bible), the following translations are listed and intended to give a fuller and better picture of Jesus’ criteria for His disciples to follow Him<br><br>

Another manner of saying “<u>to deny oneself</u>” is to <br><br>
&#8226;At once completely reject and disown one’s own life<br>
&#8226;Disown one’s life completely<br>
&#8226;Set aside selfish interests<br>

Another manner of saying “<u>to take up one’s cross (daily) </u>” is to <br><br>
&#8226;Be willing to share Jesus’ cross and experience it as one’s own<br>
&#8226;Offer oneself up to death<br>
&#8226;Embrace Jesus’ cross as one’s own<br>
&#8226;Express a willingness to endure whatever may come<br><br>

Another manner of saying “<u>follow me</u>” is to <br><br>
&#8226;Continually surrender to My ways<br>
&#8226;Walk with Me<br>
&#8226;Believe in Me <br>
&#8226;Conform to Jesus’ example in living, and if need, in suffering, and even in dying because of faith in Jesus<br>
&#8226;Become My disciple, believing and trusting in Me and walking the same path of life that I walk<br><br>

<b><font size="6">What Ingredients Comprises Jesus’ Criteria? ”</font></b><br>
The list of criteria as stated above may be self-explanatory. However, it may be worthwhile herein exploring and discussing the ingredients of Jesus’ criteria for His disciples. <br><br>
<b><font size="6">Lordship of Jesus”</font></b><br>
Firstly, let us explore and discuss “lordship” or “master”. <br><br>
The fact of the matter is that it is the lord or master that calls the shots; the lord dictates, he gives instructions. It is his will that is obeyed, it is his directions that are carried out. It is the disciple’s prerogative or right to call the shots, dictate, instruct, or direct. Amazingly, the heart of God towards His disciples is one of friendship and not ‘slavery’<a href="https://www.biblesociety.org.uk/explore-the-bible/read/eng/GNB/John/15/15"> John 15:15</a>. Because of relationship, despite His lordship, Jesus welcomes the disciples’ discussion, query to clarify, and quest to understand <a href="23_1_18">Isaiah 1:18</a>. However, the disciples’ freedom and ability ought not to be confused with opportunity to disobey, to be defiant, stubborn, resistant, absent and the like. One must remember that Jesus is on an overall basis, God, Saviour and Sovereign. He is worthy to be worshipped, reverenced and honoured. <br><br>
Therefore, the disciple must submit to the disciple maker, the Lord Jesus. If submission is missing, the walk with Jesus will be difficult if not impossible. A good example was the rich young ruler who after discussion with Jesus felt grieved and left Jesus, because He could not agree with and submit to Jesus’ requirements. He owned much property and had many possessions, which he treasured more than his relationship with God. He was not willing to sell all and give all to the poor. He preferred earthly treasures that was immediately present than heavenly treasures that would be in the distant intangible future <a href="41_10_22">Mark 10:22</a>. <br><br>
For the disciple, Jesus must be Lord of all, or not at all. Many of the disciples in the Gospels, even Paul in his letters, considered Jesus Lord, and recognized His sovereignty and yielded to His commands, His will, and His direction in their lives. <br><br>

<b><font size="6">Surrender”</font></b><br><br>
Secondly, let us explore and discuss “surrender”, which also means to yield, give in, relinquish control, give up one’s self independence to depend on another. The opposite of surrender is to resist, to rebel. <br><br>
The true-blue disciple of Jesus must properly surrender to Jesus. This involves allowing Jesus to be Lord over one’s will, desires, resources, ambition, and destiny; one’s whole life. The key to proper surrender is in the disciple’s knowledge of Who Jesus is, what is His nature and character. A wanna-be disciple must know Jesus’ loves for him, that He only has the best interests towards him. Jesus’ intentions for the disciple are only good and nothing evil or harmful. Jesus’ objective is to restore the disciple into the image and likeness of God, to build up the disciple unto maturity, to give the disciple great inheritance in God’s kingdom. <br><br>
Surrendering to the Lordship of Jesus, makes the journey of life walking with Jesus easy, smooth and joyous. The paths may lead to mountain-top experiences filled with wonder and glory, but may include valley experiences filled with great challenges, danger and fear. However, because of the disciple’s surrender, it is easy for Lord Jesus to lead and guide, teach and train. Even in the face of death the disciple can feel safe and secure because of Jesus’ Presence in life and even after one’s life<a href="https://www.biblesociety.org.uk/explore-the-bible/read/eng/GNB/Ps/23"> Psalm 23</a>. <br><br>
<b><font size="6">Disciple’s Disposition”</font></b><br>
Thirdly, let us explore and discuss what is the proper attitude, mind and heart of a disciple, his or her inherent qualities of mind and character, which will please Jesus. <br><br>
The disciple must believe in the disciple maker. The disciple must believe that the disciple maker knows where he is going, knows what he is doing, knows what is necessary for the disciple to learn and experience because the disciple maker has seen what the final product will be, what the disciple will look like at the end. If the disciple does not believe in the disciple maker, s/he will form one’s own interpretation of events, one’s own perception of circumstances, and make one’s own decision whether to freeze, stay and fight, or turn to flight. In believing and trusting in Jesus, the disciple will wait for Jesus’ timing and decisions, the disciple will defer to Jesus’ better judgement. <br><br>

The Greek word for believe is an “active” word that involves action; it is not a “passive” belief where the disciple sits and does nothing. The believer of Jesus cling onto Him, believing fervently, connotes ‘force’ and ‘power’ that propels the disciple or throws the disciple forward to do good works as a result of believing in Jesus. This sort of belief and trust in Jesus enables the disciple agility to obey Jesus’ commands, to great exploits for God’s kingdom and His glory. <br><br>
The disciple must be humble, teachable, and available. God dwells with the humble and lowly, and the contrite of heart <a href="https://www.biblesociety.org.uk/explore-the-bible/read/eng/GNB/Ps/51">Psalm 51</a>. God gives grace to the humble person but resists the prideful person <a href="59_4_6">James 4:6</a>, <a href="60_5_5">1 Peter 5:5</a>. The disciple must be a good student, learning godly character and convictions. The disciple must be available, investing time and resources to know Jesus, and where He wants the disciple to go, what He wants the disciple to do. <br><br>
The disciple must be willing to conform to His example, to His way of life, to His instructions <a href="43_14_21">John 14:21</a>, <a href="40_28_19"> Matthew 28:19</a>. The disciple must be responsive and obedient to do Jesus’ bidding. God has already shared that He has no pleasure in the one that holds back or draws back <a href="58_10_38">Hebrews 10:38</a>. <br><br>
<b><font size="6">Disciple’s Sacrifice”</font></b><br><br>
Thirdly, let us explore and discuss the disciple’s sacrifice. <br><br>
Clearly in being selfish, the disciple cannot properly obey Jesus. Selfishness blinds one to the ways and purposes of God. Selfishness is contrary and will war against God’s will. A selfish disposition is totally and completely opposite to God’s disposition of generosity, giving, sacrifice. Selfishness is carnal, sinful, greedy, distrusting, inconsiderate of God or others and the like. <br><br>
The mystery of selfishness is that in gaining the whole world, one will lose one’s own soul <a href="41_8_36">Mark 8:36</a>. Jesus hints that there is no benefit in gaining all the wealth and power of this world, with everything it could offer you, its pleasures, at the cost of one’s own life. The gain simultaneously results it the forfeit and loss. The other mystery is that he who loses his life for My sake will find it <a href="40_10_39">Matthew 10:39</a>. He who seeks to live apart from Me will lose it. He who clings to his own life (soul, self, being) will lose it all. But he who lets go of his life for my sake and surrender it all to me will discover true life! <br><br>
The focus of self does not promote God’s will and God’s ways in our life. The disciple who is obsessed with self is distracted from focusing on God Almighty, the Source of life, power, miracle working wonders. When the disciple truly lets go of the hold on one’s own life, and let’s God take control of the helm and rudder, the disciple commences the walk of life where Jesus is at the helm and controlling the rudder. Jesus who is supernatural will naturally lead the disciple through experiences full of power and victory. <br><br>
The crucifixion of self that the disciple will experience is the discipline of God upon our lives. The experience may be humiliating and excruciating, but it is necessary so that self and selfish ways can be put to death and exterminated from the disciple, and also so that God has the power and liberty to create and fashion godliness and godly character within the disciple <a href="58_12_3-11">Hebrews 12:3-11</a>. <br><br>
<b><font size="6">Conclusion”</font></b><br><br>
Jesus willingly left His heavenly abode, His position and power, His glory, and exchanged His divinity and majesty, for a life as a man, to show the world the Kingdom of God, and provide salvation to all who would believe and trust in Him. While He worked miracles and amazed multitudes, He suffered humiliation, wrongful accusations, and death on the cross, because to Him, His disciples was His joy and prize <a href="58_12_1-2">Hebrews 12:1-2</a>. Jesus is the Author of our Salvation, and the Source of our faith. He is our example. His life must be the foundation of our life and the way it is to be lived. <br><br>
As Jesus’ disciples, we must be willing to obey His commands. Since He is Lord, we must yield to His directives and timing, in full belief of Him and trust in Him. It is our privilege to be able to walk with Him, learn of Him, and conform to His ways. We want to hear Him say at the end of our life’s journey, “well done good and faithful servant, enter into the joy of your Lord” <a href="40_25_21-23"> Matthew 25:21,23</a>. <br><br>

    When God created the earth and everything in it, He had an original design and intention for each component.<br>
    God created man (male and female) in His image and likeness, where man could think, feel, plan like God <a href="1_1_2">Genesis 1:2</a>. God breathed into the form of man the breath of life, and man became a living being <a href="1_2_7">Genesis 2:7</a>. <br><br>

    God\'s design and intention:<br>
&#8226;	For man to enjoy life in relationship with God, to rule the earth, to pro-create and fill the earth<br>
&#8226;	For fish to swim in water<br>
&#8226;	For birds to fly<br>
&#8226;	For trees to be planted in the ground to bear fruit and provide shade<br><br>

    <string name="Satan_and_Demons"><![CDATA[God created angels first and then the Earth. Lucifer was the chief and leader of all the angelic beings. He was the most beautiful angel. He became proud and thought he was better than God. Sin entered his heart.
God being holy and could not allow sin to co-exist in His presence, He cast Lucifer and 1/3 of the angels who followed him out of heaven. Lucifer became Satan and the fallen angels became demons.<br>
These demonic beings only came to steal, kill, and destroy everything they could <a href="43_10_10">John 10:10</a>.<br><br>
Satan tricked man into disobeying God, committing sin, and took over man’s right to rule the earth.<br><br>

Man’s relationship with God was broken. He lost the right to enjoy abundant life and fell from glory.<br><br>
Problems then entered the equation: <br>
&#8226;	Internally: wrong choices, bad decisions, relationships, mental, physical, emotional, financial<br>
&#8226;	Externally: demonic attack, oppression, depression<br>

    <string name="Gods_Plan_to_Save"><![CDATA[From the beginning, God wanted to save man, reveal Himself to man and restore relationship with man.<br><br>
    From the beginning, man refused to respond to God (failed to understand, rebelled against, resisted, run away from God).<br><br>
    Therefore, God sent His Son Jesus to us – The Holy Spirit overshadowed Mary who was a virgin, and she conceived Jesus. Jesus was 100% God and 100% man. <br><br>
    God is one God but three persons – Father, Son, Holy Spirit. Just like man is one person but three parts – spirit, soul (mind, emotions, will), body (physical casing). The Son part of God became man.<br><br>
    Jesus’ came to reveal God’s presence with us, God’s love towards us, God’s power for us. Jesus came to bring Light and Life John 1.<br><br>
    God sent His Son Jesus to die on the cross for us. Jesus was the perfect sacrifice, The Lamb of God.<br><br>
    Because Jesus was 100% God He could not sin. Because Jesus was 100% man He lived fully dependent on and obedient to God, by the power of the Holy Spirit. He did not commit sin throughout His life.<br><br>
    Jesus’ death saved us. His bloodshed cleansed us from sin, covered us and made us acceptable to God.<br><br>
    There is no more need for animal or blood sacrifices. Jesus died once and for all.<br><br>
    God loves us. He gave. He did everything to save us, to open the way for us to have a perfect relationship with Him and eventually give us eternal life. Jesus is the way, the truth and the life <a href="43_14_6">John 14:6</a>.<br>
    &#8226;	We do not have to perform 100 hours of community service<br>
&#8226;	We do not have to inflict punishment on ourselves<br>
&#8226;	We do not have to pay any money<br>
&#8226;	Eternal life does not start when we die and go to heaven. Eternal life starts now. Eternal life is knowing God and living life with God <a href="43_17_3">John 17:3</a><br>
All we have to do is believe in our heart and confess with our mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord <a href="45_10_8-10">Romans 10:8-10,13</a>.<br>
That is all we have to do? Yes! That’s it!

    <string name="God_and_Man"><![CDATA[We just have to believe in our heart and confess with our mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and we are born again by the Holy Spirit who gives us new spirit with direct connection with God.<br><br>
After Jesus died, He rose from the dead three days later and returned to heaven to send the Holy Spirit to us. When we surrender our life to God, open our hearts, invite Him into our lives to live in and with us. The Holy Spirit breathes on us and fills us with new life. Just as God breathed on man at the beginning and gave him life, He will breathe on us and cause us to be born again <a href="">John 3</a>.<br><br>
&#8226;	Because of sin, the spirit in us is dead and separated from the life of God. When we are born again by the Spirit of God, we are spiritually alive and start to experience God’s life within us<br>
&#8226;	The Name of the Lord Jesus Christ is the only name by which we can be saved. He can help us overcome all problems and demonic attack<br>
&#8226;	Emmanuel is with us. The same resurrection power that raised Jesus from the dead is now present and actively working within us <a href="49_1_17-21">Ephesians 1:17-21</a><br>

    <string name="WHAT_DID_YOU_RECENTLY_DO"><![CDATA[You attended a meeting full of Christians. They were singing songs to God. Someone shared life experiences and a few parts of God’s Word. When they asked for people to go to the front for prayer, you responded to the call to give your life to Jesus. What have you done? The people all about you were very happy and kept saying “you are born again”. But what does that mean?]]></string>
    <string name="WHAT_DOES_BORN_AGAIN_MEAN"><![CDATA[John chapter 3 records Jesus having a discussion with a Pharisee (religious teacher) Nicodemus, who taught, “unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God” verse 3. He was not referring to a person entering his mother’s womb a second time to be born. He was talking about being born of the Holy Spirit. Jesus explained that He was speaking of “heavenly things” <a href="43_3_12">John 3:12</a> and to Nicodemus “you must be born again” <a href="43_3_7">John 3:7</a>.<br><br>
Being born again is a very simple experience where one believes in one’s heart, and says aloud, “I believe in Jesus Christ who died on the cross and rose from the dead and is alive forevermore.” The Holy Spirit is the divine heavenly breath of life that gives birth to a new spirit within us. At the time of this occurrence, some people receive a tangible touch, some feel joy and some have no feeling at all.<br><br>
This is the heart of God as recorded in <a href="43_3_16_-17">John 3:16-17</a>.
God’s heart is full of love towards all the people in the world. He loves you deeply and has been watching over you. He patiently waits for you to open up your heart and life to Him. He wants to walk out this life with you!
This is the desire of God for family relationship with anyone who would respond to him as recorded in <a href="43_1_12">John 1:12</a>.<br><br>
God wants a personal genuine and ongoing relationship with you. Jesus’ Name was also Emmanuel, which means ‘God with us’.

    <string name="God_Jesus_and_the_Holy_Spirit"><![CDATA[
God is ONE in perfect unity. He co-exists as 3 beings; Father, Son and Holy Spirit.<br><br>
God is a SPIRIT being and does not have flesh and bones. He is invisible although He is a personal being with consciousness, determination, will, intelligence and feeling. He communicates with me spiritually and in <a href="43_4_24">John 4:24</a>, Jesus explains that we connect with God through worshipping Him in spirit and in truth.<br><br>
God is LIGHT and dwells in unapproachable light <a href="54_6_15-16">1 Timothy 6:15-16</a>. God is light and in Him there is no darkness at all <a href="62_4_8">1 John 1:5</a>.<br><br>
God is LOVE <a href="62_4_8">1 John 4:8</a> and out of love for us, God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him <a href="62_4_8">1 John 4:9</a>, <a href="43_3_16">John 3:16</a>.
There are many truths to discover about this God. He is supernatural, omnipresent (present everywhere), omnipotent (all powerful) and omniscient (all knowing). God knows where you are and always seeking you. He knows everything and can do anything (well, except sin and the wrong thing) and even create something out of nothing.<br><br>
The Father is now our heavenly Father. He sent Jesus who was born of the Holy Spirit <a href="42_1_35">Luke 1:35</a> through the virgin Mary. She conceived the Son of God in her womb, who was called the Son of the Highest <a href="42_1_27">Luke 1:27,31</a>.
It was God’s earliest plans for Jesus to live on earth and experience every temptation known to man. Through Jesus’ life, mankind would learn of God’s will, God’s love, God’s teachings and God’s miraculous working power. This is especially so when God let Jesus died on the cross <a href="66_13_8">Revelation 13:8</a>, be buried, and resurrected from death to life on the third day.<br><br>
1.	Jesus died on the cross so that:<br><br>
a.	We are forgiven and redeemed from all our sins.<br>
b.	The sinless blood shed on the cross washes me, cleanses me, forgives me of all my wrongdoings, covers me and protects me<br>
c.	I am set free from every curse, bondage, disease, sickness, pain and suffering<br>
d.	I could be reconciled to Father God and be able to call Him Abba Father<br>
e.	I could start a relationship with Him with direct access to Him<br><br>
2.	God resurrected Jesus from death and grave so that:<br><br>
a.	Jesus could ascend to heaven to be seated at the right hand of Father God, and currently interceding for me and the world<br>
b.	Jesus could pave the way for the Holy Spirit (Helper, Counsellor, Teacher, House mate, Power bank) to rebirth many children of God<br>
c.	The Holy Spirit could make His home in me, live in me, and help me in every aspect of my life<br>
d.	The Holy Spirit would be poured out on my life to fill me, anoint me, empower me, live through me to do and accomplish great things<br>
e.	The Holy Spirit would restore my spiritual senses (eyes to see, ears to hear, tongue to taste, skin to touch, nose to smell), my mind to discern the will of God, and my heart to respond to God<br>
f.	The Holy Spirit would lead and guide me according to God’s will and way

    <string name="Next_Step"><![CDATA[Congratulations on making the decision to be born again, to become a Child of God, a Christian (a Christ-like one)! Now, let’s discuss your new life.<br><br>
Being born again is like crossing a bridge towards a new life. Physically, the current circumstances of your life probably remain unchanged; the same life, home, family, school, job… However, spiritually, things are radically different. You now have a new identity in Christ! Now, you ARE a Child of God with a heavenly Father and Jesus, your brother and friend. You have a Counsellor, Teacher, Guide and Helper! You belong to a new spiritual family with many brothers and sisters in Christ!<br><br>
Being born again of the Holy Spirit means you now have a new spirit with God’s DNA. His life is flowing in and through you, the blood of Jesus covers you, the Word of God will shed light on how you ought to live, and all of God’s heavenly kingdom is on your side.<br><br>
From now on, the old way is gone and the new is before you <a href="46_5_17">1 Corinthians 5:17</a>. You are in Christ! And in Christ, you have all the inheritance of God, all the resources of God, all the authority of God, everything that Jesus has accomplished by His life, death and resurrection. They are yours to claim! Does that make you feel special, favoured, blessed, loved or invincible? Here are some practical ways to jumpstart your NEW life:<br><br>
1.	Determine to stay committed to God, come what may, whatever happens, no “if” and no “but”. In whatever circumstance, your response should be “I love you God, I trust you completely, I will obey Your Word”. God will be with you and walk with you till the very end. He is faithful. He will never leave you nor forsake you. Keep fighting, till the very end!<br>
2.	Grow as a Christian. Remember that you are a newborn spiritually. There is plenty of learning and growing to do to be nurtured into an infant, toddler, child, adolescent, young adult and a mature adult. God has a good plan, a high calling and purpose, a great destiny for you. It starts with developing godly Christian character, maturity, and wisdom to make right decisions.<br>
3.	Start reading God’s Word, beginning with the books of John and Psalms.<br>
4.	Plant yourself in a local church that loves God, worships God, teaches the Word of God as well as relies on the Holy Spirit to lead and guide the church. Persevere even if people are not the nicest, even if misunderstandings and offences occur, even if you feel that things can be done better. The circumstances are perfect ground for you to learn Christian values, Christian character, God’s ways and how to deal with situations and live with others in peace and harmony. If you see a need, lend a helping hand. Serve and do what you can.<br>
5.	Fellowship with Christians who love God, His Word and His Spirit. They can teach and mentor you, walk with you as well as encourage and pray for you.<br>
6.	Discern and do what is right according to God’s commands.<br>
7.	Consider God’s Word daily. Learn of God’s ways and discover the truth about Jesus’ victory and authority, and your identity in Christ. Most importantly, enjoy the journey and watch your life transform. The truth gives liberty!

    <string name="DNA_Prayer"><![CDATA[In the writer’s opinion and experience, prayer is a wonderful (full of wonder) phenomenon and potentially an amazing adventure full of pleasant surprises, such as miracles!<br><br>
   As an introduction, let’s address some misconceptions of prayer. Prayer is not a one-way street, where one talks to God the ‘sugar daddy’ or ‘father Christmas’, whose sole purpose is to grant one’s requests. It is not true that God only listens if one is ‘good’, and prayer only yields results after one puts in the requisite action. Prayer is not penance done in fear, to earn God’s forgiveness and acceptance. One does not have to beg or bargain and use Christian jargon or bombastic language. Prayer is not boring, and it certainly is not the solution to insomnia. It is not all about ‘me’ and it is not only about the future. Scripture also describes what <b>prayer is not</b>:<br><br>
a.	Showing off to be seen by men <a href="40_6_5">Matthew 6:5</a>.<br>
b.	Vain repetitions that people use thinking they will be heard for their many words <a href="40_6_7">Matthew 6:7</a>.<br>
c.	Consulting with witches/wizards, mediums, evil spirits, omens for guidance <a href="46_10_13">1 Chronicles 10:13</a>, <a href="47_33_6">2 Chronicles 33:6</a>, <a href="23_8_19-22">Isaiah 8:19-22</a>, <a href="23_47_8-14">Isaiah 47:8-14</a> because God considers this to be an evil practice that defiles Him <a href="4_18_10-14">Deuteronomy 18:10-14</a>, <a href="3_19_31">Leviticus 19:31</a>, <a href="3_20_6-7">Leviticus 20:6-7</a> and is tantamount to witchcraft <a href="48_5_19-21">Galatians 5:19-21</a>, <a href="66_18_23">Revelation 18:23</a>.<br><br>

<b>What is Prayer?</b><br>
1.	Firstly, the most important foundational understanding about prayer is that it must naturally flow out of <b>one’s relationship with God</b>.<br>
&nbsp;a.	The Spirit of adoption in us bears witness that we are the children of God, adopted into God’s family, and God is Abba Father. We are confident in having the same standing as Jesus to inherit everything that belongs to God! <a href="45_8_15-17">Romans 8:15-17</a>, <a href="48_4_6">Galatians 4:6</a>. Jesus called out to Abba Father too <a href="41_14_36">Mark 14:36</a>. This Aramaic word has connotations of relationship and intimacy special to this family, and not shared with outsiders. Jesus gave us the blood connection with God, and the legal right to be placed into God’s family <a href="43_1_12">John 1:12</a>. It is out of this relationship with God that we pray.<br>
&nbsp;b.	We have access to the Father through Jesus <a href="49_2_18">Ephesians 2:18</a>, <a href="43_14_6">John 14:6</a>. We can enter the holy place by Jesus’ blood <a href="58_10_19-22">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>.<br>
&nbsp;c.	Prayer requires a bit of time to align our focus on a loving God with proper communication.<br>
&nbsp;d.	Prayer connects us with our Father in heaven, who is Supernatural, Almighty and All-powerful. He is the Creator who creates things out of nothing. Therefore prayer connects us to a divine source of power. The analogy of an electrical cord being plugged into a power source in the wall, shows how power immediately enables the lamp to light up and give light. That is prayer; connection to power.<br>
2.	Jesus taught that the place where believers gather must be a “house of prayer” <a href="40_21_13">Matthew 21:13</a>. Since we are the temple of the Holy Spirit <a href="46_6_19">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>, then individually, we must be a “house of prayer”. Therefore, prayer is imperative both personally and in the church community.<br>
3.	Jesus taught His disciples to:<br>
&nbsp; a.	Pray “to the Father” <a href="40_6_6-9">Matthew 6:6,9</a>.<br>
&nbsp; b.	Pray “in Jesus’ Name” <a href="43_16_23-27">John 16:23-27</a>.<br>
4.	Pray with the help of the Holy Spirit <a href="45_8_26-27">Romans 8:26-27</a>.<br><br>

<b>How to Pray?</b> See the following types of prayer described in Scriptures. <br>
5.	Jesus’ taught about prayer and God’s loving attitude towards those who pray to Him <a href="43_16_23-27">John 16:23-27</a>.<br>
a.	The Bible elaborates how God views our prayers, which we must understand in order to practice effective and successful prayers. <br>
i.	Jesus will not do the praying for you! Why? Because it is not necessary. The Father Himself loves you, so you have to pray to the Father yourself! In other words, DIY prayers. Jesus expects you to go directly to the Father and ask Him for anything you desire. <br>
ii.	Ask and keep on asking. <br>
iii.	God will give you and you will receive. <br>
iv.	Because Father God loves you, you ask in Jesus’ Name, you ask out of relationship with Jesus, acting as Jesus’ representative (presenting all that I AM, agreeing with what Jesus would agree on, in accordance with God’s will). <br>
v.	Because God wants your joy to be complete, full and unlimited! <br>
6.	Jesus also taught: <br>
a.	Pray continually and persistently, then your prayers will be answered <a href="42_18_1-8">Luke 18:1-8</a>. <br>
b.	Pray with faith (which can move mountains) <a href="41_11_22-24">Mark 11:22-24</a>. <br>
c.	Ask, seek, knock (and you will receive, find, get an opening) <a href="40_7_7">Matthew 7:7</a>. <br>
d.	Watch and pray (to prevent one from falling into temptation, into sin) <a href="40_26_41">Matthew 26:41</a>, <a href="42_22_32">Luke 22:32</a>. <br>
e.	He has given the church (legislative assembly) the keys (symbol of authority and ruling power) of heaven’s kingdom to bind (forbid, declare to be improper and unlawful) and let loose (permit) on Earth. This is done by an indisputable authority, and it shall be similarly done in heaven <a href="40_16_18-19">Matthew 16:18-19</a>. <br>
7.	Paul taught us how to pray: <br>
a.	Unceasingly <a href="52_5_17">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a><br>
b.	With thanksgiving <a href="52_5_18">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a><br>
c.	Without anxiety but with thanksgivings, presenting our requests and supplications to God, allowing God’s peace to guard our hearts and minds <a href="50_4_6-7">Philippians 4:6-7</a><br>
d.	Fervently and effectively (for miracles even to stop rain and bring rain) <a href="59_5_16-20">James 5:16-20</a>. <br>
e.	Pray and be watchful <a href="51_4_2">Colossians 4:2</a><br><br>

<b>The Various types of Prayer</b><br><br>

8.	Pray prophetic and intercessory prayers for God to rend the Heavens and come down <a href="23_64_1">Isaiah 64:1</a>, bringing God’s kingdom into our midst <a href="40_6_9">Matthew 6:9</a>, for God’s will to be done. <br>
9.	Pray for one another<br>

        <b><font size="6">Section A	INTRODUCTION</font></b><br><br>
You are born again into the Kingdom of God John 3 and are a new spiritual person with a new spiritual life in Christ. In order to ensure a successful Christian life, it is vital that you start off and build your Christian faith on the right foundation. Obviously, you want a smooth sail rather than a faith shipwrecked <a href="54_1_19">1 Timothy 1:19</a>.<li>
<ol>
<li>You are a Born-again Christian (BAC) John 3. Jesus taught that when you believe in Him <a href="45_10_8-10">Romans 10:8-10</a> the Holy Spirit breathes new life into you <a href="43_20_20">John 20:20</a> and you have everlasting life <a href="43_3_16">John 3:16</a>. You can see and enter the kingdom of God <a href="43_3_3">John 3:3,5</a>.<li>
<li>You are a new creation, the old is passed away, all things have become new <a href="47_5_17">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>.<li>
<li>One must put off the old man and put on the new man <a href="49_4_22">Ephesians 4:22,24</a><li>
<li>Jesus taught that new wine must <b>always</b> be poured into new wineskins <a href="42_5_37-38">Luke 5:37-38</a>. If new wine was poured into old wineskins, the old wineskin will burst, and the new wine will be lost. He does not want Christians to refuse to taste the new that He brings. <a href="42_5_39">Luke 5:39</a>.<li><br>
</ol>
If you are new to iHeart, we want you to taste the new and the good of God that He intends and desires for you. In order for you to be ‘new’ and experience the good, it is necessary to wipe clean the slate of anything and everything ‘old’, such as worldly ways, religious practices, traditional programs, man-made artificial methods, wrong thinking, entrenched habits, prejudices and biases. Now is a new beginning, and one must be willing to start on a clean slate. The next 3 sections will discuss “how”.<br><br><br>


<b><font size="6">Section B	GOOD ROOTS</font></b><br><br>
God wants you to root out, pull down, destroy and throw down, build and plant <a href="24_1_9-10">Jeremiah 1:9-10</a>.<br>
By natural law, a plant with bad roots will yield a bad stem with bad branches and bad fruit. The results will be negative and unhelpful. Such a tree is dead to Jesus <a href="41_11_12-14">Mark 11:12-14<a>, <a href="41_11_20-21">20-21</a>. In contrast, a plant ought to have good roots, because what it will yield is good stem with good branches and good fruit worthy of blessing to those looking for food and nourishment.<br><br>

[Picture of bad roots (plant), good roots (plant)]<br><br>
The question is ‘what’ needs to be rooted out, pulled down, destroyed and thrown down?<br><br>

<ol>
  <li>	One must put off the old man <a href="49_4_17-22">Ephesians 4:17-22</a> which includes one’s former conduct, futile thinking, darkened understanding, corrupt logic, alienation from the life of God, ignorance of God’s ways, blind heart, past feeling, deep seated moral darkness, spiritual apathy that has caused one’s life to be surrendered to lewdness, unclean work, impurity and sexual obsession.</li>
<li>	Jesus does not want us to be stiff-necked, dull of heart, hard of hearing, closed eyes <a href="40_13_14-15">Matthew 13:14-15</a>. Jesus taught His disciples that there are 3 types of grounds (heart conditions) that is not conducive to Christian growth.</li>
<ul>
<li>The beaten path or wayside heart receives God’s word of the kingdom but does not seek understanding and allows the birds of the air (devil) to snatch away the seed sown in one’s heart.</li>
<li>The gravel path or stony heart receives God’s word of the kingdom with joy and gladness, but the experience is shallow and does not allow the word to take root and sink deep inside. Through time, trials and persecution, this one is quick to stumble and fall.</li>
<li>The path of weeds or thorny heart receives God’s word of the kingdom but allows the cares and distractions of this world, the ambition for wealth, and the deceitfulness of riches, to choke and suffocate the word. This one has a divided heart which prevents him from bearing spiritual fruit.</li>
</ul>
<li>Some heart conditions and attitudes that is ‘bad roots’ include pride, stubbornness, wrong teaching from parents and teachers, hurts from the past. Removing all of these will help in growing properly and successfully as a Christian.</li>


If you observe a Christian that is facing difficulty in growing, difficulty in understanding the things of God, life that is stagnant dry and frustrated, bearing no fruit, offended bitter and cynical, it is quite possible that this Christian is founded on bad roots.<br><br>
The other question is ‘what’ to build and plant to result in a good Christian life and experience? However, before one can build and plant, one must ensure the roots are good. The following points will ensure ‘good roots’.<br><br>

<li>	One must put on the new man <a href="49_4_22-24">Ephesians 4:22-24</a> by renewing the spirit of my mind through new revelations of Christ as I live in union with Him. This re-creates me in true righteousness and true holiness. As I allow my mind and heart to be renewed, my whole life and lifestyle will be transformed, and I will live out the will and purposes of God <a href="45_12_1-2">Romans 12:1-2</a>.</li>
<li>	Jesus wants you to hear and understand, see and perceive, understand with your heart, turn and receive healing <a href="40_13_14-15">Matthew 13:14-15</a>.</li>
<li>	Jesus wants Christians to have good roots and good ground, who hear the word of God, fully embrace it, and seeks full understanding and application. These produce good fruit and yield a harvest up to a hundred times as much as was sown <a href="40_13_3-9">Matthew 13:3-9</a>,<a href="40_13_18-23">18-23</a>.</li><br>

At iHeart, we want all Christians to have good roots and be a good plant, and we have worked out that the key for this to occur is the heart condition and attitudes of Desire, Humility, Availability, and be Teachable (DHAT).<br><br>

When one is built and planted properly, <a href="19_1_2-3">Psalm 1:2-3</a> describes the following good experience:<br><br>
<li>Planted by streams of water – source of life, good nourishment, refreshing, freshness and vitality</li>
<li>	Yields fruit in season – life of health and productivity, good works</li>
<li>	Leaf does not wither – no dying, dryness, lifelessness, instead there is continual growth</li>
<li>	Everything that one does prospers – life of success and achievement, wholeness and peace</li><br>
</ol>
<b><font size="6">Section C	MIND</font></b><br><br>

The Bible teaches in <a href="47_10_3-6">2 Corinthians 10:3-6</a> that the mental strongholds are thoughts attitudes and knowledge that oppose God and prevents one from proper Christian growth. If one desires to grow from new born to maturity, it will be necessary to dismantle demolish and break all such things, take it captive, and bring it to obedience of Christ.<br>
The idle weak and undisciplined mind can be the devil’s playground. One’s commitment is to fill one’s mind with the knowledge of God, understand one’s spiritual weapons which are Holy Spirit divine power to:<br>
<ol>
<li>	Dismantle defences effectively<li>
<li>	Demolish deceptive fantasy that opposes God<li>
<li>	Break through every arrogant attitude that is defiant and raised up against the true knowledge of God<li>
<li>	Capture as prisoners of war every thought into obedience of Christ<li>
</ol>
A Christian is saved (when born again), being saved (throughout one’s life), and will be saved (finally). Therefore be ready for a life-long process of continuous and unending responsive to spiritual learning and lessons.<br><br>

<b><font size="6">Section D	DIE TO SELF</font></b><br><br>

Another key to growth is to understand the elementary truths in <a href="58_6_1">Hebrews 6:1</a> which are:<br><br>

<ol>
<li>The lordship of Christ – Christ is our Lord and sits on the throne of our heart. Jesus’ last words after His work was done on earth and before returning to His heavenly abode included that we ought to teach people to obey everything that He commanded <a href="40_28_18-20">Matthew 28:18-20</a>.</li>
<li>One’s repentance from dead works. Repentance is the changing of one’s mind from a life of independence to a life surrendered to God and His will <a href="42_3_3">Luke 3:3,8</a>. Dead works are all of our efforts done without being surrendered to the lordship of Christ, and therefore done ignorant of the knowledge of God and independent of God’s will <a href="40_7_21-23">Matthew 7:21-23</a>.</li>
<li>One’s faith towards God – belief in Christ that propels one to active application of all the truth in one’s daily lifestyle in the knowledge of God’s will and in obedience to the leading of the Holy Spirit <a href="45_8_14">Romans 8:14</a>.
<li>One’s good works (fruit) – one’s thoughts and deeds expressed in alignment with God’s will <a href="40_5_14">Matthew 5:14</a>.</li>
<li>One must die to self (selfish desires), flesh (fleshly lusts), take up cross daily (Jesus’ teaching) <a href="40_16_24">Matthew 16:24</a>.</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>Don’t love the world <a href="62_2_15-17">1 John 2:15-17</a><li>
<li>Flee temptation <a href="54_2_22">2 Timothy 2:22</a>, <a href="59_1_14">James 1:14</a><li>
<li>Do not covet <a href="45_13_9">Romans 13:9</a> but be content <a href="58_6_1">Philippians 4:11-13</a><li>

    <string name="Community_and_relationship">
         <![CDATA[
            <b><font size="6">God’s original design and intentions</font></b><br><br>
            From the beginning of time, God’s intention for man was one of community and relationship. <br><br>
            God emphasised the importance of developing and maintaining meaningful relationships between people. “It is not good that man (ish) should be alone” <a href="1_2_18">Genesis 2:18</a>. He created woman (ishshah) who was a perfect counterpart to man <a href="1_2_23">Genesis 2:23</a> because God wanted man (male and female) to be fruitful and multiply, and exercise dominion together <a href="1_1_23">Genesis 1:28</a>.<br><br>
            God also wanted a relationship with man. God walked in the garden and called to Adam (male and female) wanting to fellowship with them <a href="1_3_8-10">Genesis 3:8-10</a>. Unfortunately, this was a negative interaction because of the prior sinful acts of both the woman and man who had disobeyed God’s instructions of abstaining from eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil <a href="1_2_16-17">Genesis 2:16-17</a>. This tells us that God wants to have a positive and healthy relationship with us, which must be based on us ‘doing the right thing’ and obeying God’s instructions to us.<br><br>
            God wants to bring blessings upon all families. Later, we read of God commanding Abram to venture out of the comfort zone of his country, family and father’s house <a href="1_12_1-3">Genesis 12:1-3</a>. God did so because He wanted Abram to walk with Him and learn to live in a relationship with God. God’s intention for his life and destiny were:<br><br>
            •	Make Abram a great nation <br>
            •	God will bless him abundantly <br>
            •	God will make his name great <br>
            •	Abram will be a blessing <br>
            •	In Abram all the families of the earth shall be blessed <br><br>

            When James wrote his letter to the Christians some 2000 years later, he stated that “the Scripture was fulfilled that says, ‘Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness,’ and he was called the friend of God” <a href="59_2_23">James 2:23</a>.<br><br>

            <b><font size="6">Covenant relationships</font></b> <br>
            God is big on relationships and community. Through the course of time, He made covenants with various people to show His commitment to the relationships He had with individuals such as Adam, Noah, Abraham and David among others. A covenant is likened to a contractual relationship between 2 people, where there are terms and obligations for each party to fulfil, accompanied with a seal.<br><br>
            The most recent and best covenant God made with mankind is the one through Jesus Christ. God became flesh and dwelt among man. His Name was Jesus, God’s only begotten Son, and through Jesus, man obtained the right to become children of God with direct access to intimate relationship with God. God opened heaven’s resources for His children. Man’s obligation in this covenant is to believe in Jesus as Lord and Saviour and learning to live in God’s ways. God’s seal for this covenant was the broken body of Jesus and the blood Jesus shed for our sins. Jesus did this to redeem us from sin and the punishment for sin, for His glory and purposes.<br><br>
            God also emphasises the importance of His people living in community and building meaningful relationships with one another. Jesus prayed for God’s people to live in unity <a href="">John 17</a>. It is important for us to realise that just as God made His commitments to His people, He desires for His people to be committed to one another, to stay in relationship and be loyal to one another. After all, Jesus’ body and blood bind us to each other. Jesus spoke about we having to “abide in Him” <a href="43_15_4_9">John 15:4-9</a> and the Holy Spirit making His home in us and being with us <a href="43_14_16-18">John 14:16-18</a>. It’s one big family in God.<br><br>

            <b><font size="6">New Testament church community</font></b><br>
            After Jesus died, was buried, resurrected and returned to His home in heaven, Jesus sent the Holy Spirit, who gave birth to the church Acts 2. This passage of Scripture provides the characteristics of church life and church community:<br>
            1.	They were all with one accord <a href="43_2_1">Acts 2:1</a>.<br>
            2.	They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke in tongues by the Holy Spirit <a href="43_2_4">Acts 2:4</a>.<br>
            3.	They were all normal people who made a huge impact to those around. People marvelled, were amazed, bewildered, dumbfounded and astonished. People had questions including “who are they”, “how is this possible”, “what shall we do” <a href="43_2_7,12">Acts 2:7,12</a>.<br>
            4.	They had favour with everyone <a href="43_2_47">Acts 2:47</a>.<br>
            5.	All who believed and repented were baptised in the Name of Jesus Christ and received the gift of the Holy Spirit <a href="43_2_38,41">Acts 2:38, 41</a>.<br>
            6.	They faithfully devoted themselves to teachings (apostles’ doctrine), fellowship (hearts were mutually linked to one another as one body), communion, (coming together regularly for) prayers <a href="43_2_42">Acts 2:42</a>.<br>
            7.	Apostles performed miracles, signs and wonders <a href="43_2_43">Acts 2:43</a>.<br>
            8.	Everyone was generous, shared their possessions and goods, sold their assets and distributed among the needy <a href="43_2_45">Acts 2:45</a>.<br>
            9.	They were together daily, in the temple (church building) and in various houses.<br>
            10.	Their attitude was of fear (reverence for God and His ways, deep sense of holy awe) <a href="43_2_43">Acts 4:43</a>.<br>
            11.	They shared their meals together with gladness, joyful hearts and simplicity (humility) of heart <a href="43_2_46">Acts 2:46</a>.<br>
            12.	They were continually filled with praises to God (praise and worship) <a href="43_2_47">Acts 2:47</a>.<br>
            13.	The Lord added new believers to their numbers daily <a href="43_2_47">Acts 2:47</a>.<br><br>

            As the early church grew, the godly culture to be practised within the community was further clarified by the apostles who wrote letters to the various churches. These letters were collectively canonised into the New Testament Bible that is available to us today. Some characteristics of God’s community include the following:<br><br>

            •	Faith, hope and love <a href="43_2_47">1 Corinthians 13</a>.<br>
            •	Be like-minded, be of one accord, exemplify the same love, be of one mind, be of the same mind as Jesus <a href="43_2_47">Philippians 2:1-11</a>. <br>
            •	Have double honour for elders who govern well, who labour in the word and doctrine <a href="43_2_47">1 Timothy 5:17</a>.<br>
            •	Forgive with sincerity everyone who owes you a debt, who trespass against you <a href="43_2_47">Matthew 18:21-35</a>. Forgive up to seventy times seven (ie 490 times) <a href="43_2_47">Matthew 18:21-22</a>.<br>
            •	Lay down one’s right, die to self and remove selfishness.<br>
            •	Honour, esteem and respect one another.<br>
            •	Put others before yourself and serve one another <a href="43_2_47">Galatians 5:13</a>.

            The DNA and culture of the early church community birthed by the Holy Spirit, is also the same DNA and culture that we want iHeart Church community to possess.
            <br><br>
            Some of the DNA and culture that iHeart wishes to cultivate, promote and practise include the following:<br>
            <br><br>

            •	God is interested in all kinds and all types of people. We will love them and welcome them. Therefore, we do not want to be judgemental, prejudicial, racist or biased against anyone in any way.<br>
            •	We must be embracing, inclusive, looking out for people who are shy, lonely and uncomfortable. We must also reach out and integrate people into the iHeart community. We will help them fit in by warmly welcoming them. No one should be left alone, feel lonely, ignored, shunned or avoided.<br>
            •	We avoid cliques because while cliques are great, it is exclusive to those within the clique. People outside of the cliques can feel left out, ostracised and discriminated against. This is not the community we want to build in iHeart.<br>
            •	Get rid of bad attitudes, wrongful conduct, complaints, criticism, negative thinking and actions completely.<br>
            •	Because of our unique personalities, diverse backgrounds and upbringings, as well as differences in education, we are wired very differently. Occasionally friction arises and sparks fly. The important thing is to adopt the right response of having a forgiving attitude <a href="51_3_12-14">Colossians 3:12-14</a>, seeking clarification, being willing to change oneself (and not the other), mutually working out a resolution and a way to move forward with strategies in place to avoid future friction and sparks. We note the thought that iron sharpens iron. We must cover each other’s backs (so to speak), shield and protect each other, be loyal to one another <a href="20_18_24">Proverbs 18:24</a> and go out of our way to help a brother in need.<br>
            •	Our community must be one of love, peace, unity and humility.<br>
            Jesus showed the greatest type of love and friendship, by laying down His own life for us, whom He considered His friends <a href="43_15_13">John 15:13</a>. That is the type of heart condition we want in the iHeart community.

            <b><font size="6">Family of God</font></b><br>
            The community of God must include people from all ages and from all walks of life. Spiritually, we want inter-generational connections between all Christians. This starts from the spiritual grandparents who discipled the spiritual parents, who then disciple young Christians, and who in turn are reproducing themselves in baby Christians. <br><br>

            <b><font size="6">Church services</font></b><br>
            It is important for Christians who call iHeart ‘home’ to sanctify and set aside time and effort to attend gatherings and meetings as much as possible <a href="58_10_25">Hebrews 10:25</a>.<br><br>

            During celebration services, we are stage makers setting the stage for the Holy Spirit to come (manifest His presence) and minister to the congregation. We want to create an atmosphere conducive for God to touch people, and for people to touch God! We want to join the heavenly hosts in worshipping God 24/7!<br><br>

            When Christians gather, it is a time of:<br><br>

            •	Celebrating life in God and worshipping God together.<br>
            •	Fellowship; sharing testimonies and burdens, celebrating achievements and victories.<br>
            •	Praying and seeking God together, specifically for those who are sick, facing trials, needing intercession for difficult circumstances and breakthrough or even impartation.<br>
            •	Serving one another, extending hospitality as well as showing love and kindness.<br>
            •	Training and equipping.<br><br>

            We have experienced again and again, the favours and blessings of God when one makes a priority to attend the Christian gatherings and plans one’s calendar according to Church events. Jesus taught that we must seek first God’s kingdom and God’s ways, and all the things that we need and want will indeed be added unto us <a href="40_6_33">Matthew 6:33</a>.<br><br>

            The book of Acts records that the people of God met daily, both at homes, and in buildings of worship (temples).<br><br>

            From the beginning of time, God taught us to remember Him as we care for one another. We must care for one another in the way God has treated us. This is one of the truths of communion that Jesus taught. <br><br>

            Questions<br>
            1.	Are you comfortable being alone? What about being in a crowd of people?<br>
            2.	Do you find it easy to initiate and maintain a conversation with someone new to you?<br>
            3.	Describe your family and your experience growing up in your family.<br>
            4.	Describe your experience of the church services?

            <b><font size="6">Being planted </font></b><br><br>
            The aim of this lesson is to have a better understanding of what “planting” and “being planted” truly mean. Over this next chapter, we will unravel its meaning in a simple, systematic and practical way.<br><br>

            1.	Simply, it means to be rooted into the ground where you can have a strong foundation and grow upwards. <br>
            2.	Systematically, all plants need to be planted with its roots in the soil. Otherwise, they will dry out and the plant will wither and die.<br>
            3.	Practically, a plant must remain planted in appropriate soil for these reasons:  <br>
                &nbsp; a.	Anchor the plant to the ground;<br>
                &nbsp; b.	Support and keep plant upright;<br>
                &nbsp; c.	Absorb water, nutrients and minerals from the soil to nourish the plant for growth; and<br>
                &nbsp; d.	Store food and nutrients.<br>

            <b><font size="6">How do I fit in God’s garden? </font></b><br><br>
            Psalm 1 paints the following picture for our understanding:<br>
            •	Our life is like a garden with many paths (<a href="19_1_1">v1</a>). Some paths are bad (v1 wicked, sinner, scorner) and lead to doom (<a href="19_1_6">v6</a>), while some are good (<a href="19_1_1">v1</a>, <a href="19_1_">v6</a>) and lead to prosperity. (<a href="19_1_3">v3</a>)<br>
            •	As a gardener, God will tend, trim, prune and prepare those plants that wants to be worked on (<a href="19_1_6">v6</a>). However, he ignores those that do not (<a href="19_1_4">v4</a>, <a href="19_1_5">v5</a>)<br>
            •	We should be plants that are rooted in the ground of His Word, firm and founded in truth and nourished by God and His blissful waters (Holy Spirit) (<a href="19_1_3">v3</a>)<br>
            •	We should always aim to be trees that grow unto maturity, spreading out our branches to provide shade and fruit in order to prosper and bless others (<a href="19_1_3">v3</a>)<br><br>

            <a href="43_15_1-8">John 15:1-8</a> described our Father God as the Vinedresser. (<a href="43_15_1">v1</a>) His hands works on our lives skilfully like a potter in order to mould, shape and fashion us into masterpieces.  On the other hand, Jesus is the true Vine in whom we must abide (<a href="43_15_4">v4</a>) in order to bear fruits, while we are the very branches where these fruits will grow (<a href="43_15_8">v8</a>). We draw provision and sustenance from Jesus, the source of all things, in order to grow, be productive in bearing fruits and bless others. <br><br>

            <b><font size="6">What type of ground?</font></b><br><br>
            In order for plants to reach their maximum growth potential and fruition, the ground must also be suitable and appropriate for the plant. Jesus taught in <a href="40_13_1-9">Matthew 13:1-9</a>, <a href="40_13_18-23">18-23</a> a parable describing seeds that represent the word of God being sown onto 4 types of soils. These 4 soils illustrate the types of heart conditions onto which God’s word fall on. The parable then goes on to explain how the conditions of our hearts will respond differently to the word of God planted in us. <br><br>

            a.	Seeds that fall on the wayside: the heart lacks understanding, and the wicked one comes and snatches away the Word in the heart.<br>
            b.	Seeds that fall on stony places: the heart is joyful and excited temporarily, but does not allow the Word to take root deep within. Hence, tribulation or persecution causes the person to stumble, trip up and injure himself. <br>
            c.	Seeds that fall among thorns: the heart hears the words of God but permits the worldly ways, the cares and anxieties of life as well as wealth and materialistic pursuits to choke the Word. Hence, there is stagnation and no growth. <br>
            d.	Seeds that fall on good ground: the heart is conducive for the word of God. This person hears, understands, bears fruits and becomes productive.<br><br>

            We aim to be the good fertile ground, possessing the right heart condition that is suitable for God’s Words to fall on, take root, grow and bear multiple fruits. We must continue to let God sow in us and allow him to nurture us into trees of righteousness that bear evergreen leaves, and remain blessed, prosperous and fruitful in every season of life.<br>

            <b><font size="6">Real life practical planting</font></b><br><br>
            You must be asking: “So, I now understand that I am a plant that must be planted in good soil, but what is the real life implication? Where should I be planted in order to take root, get nourished and blossom? <br><br>

            Consider the following conditions as a guideline for good ground to be planted in:<br><br>
            •	A spiritual family who will:<br>
            &nbsp;    o	Love and accept me for everything that I am, and allow me to be myself<br>
            &nbsp;    o	Provide a place of safety, refuge, and rest<br>
            &nbsp;    o	Look out and protect me from danger, as well as challenge me to grow and stretch<br>
            &nbsp;    o	Encourage the nurturing of covenant relationships that stand the test of time<br>
             &nbsp;   o	Teach me to value and build inter-generational relationships (spiritual father, mother, brother and among others)<br><br>
            •	A community of believers who will:<br>
            &nbsp;    o	Journey together through life’s mountain and valley experiences<br>
            &nbsp;    o	Live in unity and harmony despite individual differences, and have the same heart and mind like Christ did<br>
            &nbsp;    o	Apply the fruits of the Holy Spirit <a href="48_5_22-23">Galatians 5:22-23</a> and exercise covering of love and prayer over each other, especially shortcomings and weaknesses<br>
            &nbsp;    o	Practise forgiveness, graciousness and love for one another<br>
            •	A culture of God’s Kingdom that encompasses:<br>
            &nbsp;    o	Learning of Godly Kingdom culture together <br>
            &nbsp;    o	Discipleship by walking through a Godly lifestyle alongside one other, and mutually stirring one another to grow in knowledge and godly maturity<br>
            &nbsp;    o	Teaching of the word with transformational power and revelational experiences<br>
            &nbsp;    o	Exercising our spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy<br><br>

            •	A church that advances the Kingdom of God based on <a href="44_2_41-47">Acts 2:41-47</a> and with the following characteristics:<br>
             &nbsp;   o	Shepherds that promote a culture of love, using the staff and rod to provide comfort, vision, guidance, instruction, correction and teaching to the sheep, who in turn respond positively<br>
             &nbsp;   o	Stage-makers in the sanctuary of God to welcome the Holy Spirit, allowing Him to manifest His Presence, love and power to touch people and for people to touch God<br>
             &nbsp;   o	Venue where the glory of God can manifest and pour out His spirit on us as we lift up our worship and praise with sincere and grateful hearts<br>
             &nbsp;   o	Community with a welcoming and hospitable spirit, expressing love for all kinds and all types of people<br>
             &nbsp;   o	Sanctuary for people to gather and experience God’s miracles, signs and wonders, where healing of the spirit, soul and body occur<br>
             &nbsp;   o	Commitment to the Spirit and the Word<br><br>

             It is imperative to source a church that is good ground and conducive for growth and fruition in the long term. We encourage you to pray and seek the Holy Spirit to guide and lead you to the right church for you to be planted in.<br><br>

             Our deepest desire is to create a church, culture, community and family in iHeart Melbourne Church with all traits described above. We invite you to come and be planted in this good ground for us to grow together.<br><br>

            <b><font size="6">What does planting mean?</font></b><br><br>
            Planting means to take root, where a plant stays put and remains as long as it needs to grow into a tall unwavering mighty oak tree of righteousness. <br><br>
            We know that constant uprooting of a plant from one place to another will hinder its growth. The plant may still grow but not steadily or as fast as those that stay put and remain in one place. This is because the process of being constantly uprooted may invariably damage or injure parts of the plant that are essential to reach its full potential. <br><br>

            <b>To draw the link, we ARE those plants that ARE to be planted in a church.</b><br><br>

            To be planted means we do NOT want to be: <br><br>

            •	Hopping from church to church seeking after sensationalism and be thrilled by the music of a band or the sermon of a speaker;<br>
            •	Attending as many conferences as possible to ‘sit under the anointing’ of every ‘BTO’ (big time operator) or chase after ‘the prophetic’ or ‘supernatural encounters’; and<br>
            •	Following speakers and ministers who travel from place to place, locally or internationally.<br>

            Obviously there is absolutely nothing wrong with visiting different churches to share in their celebration experience of God, observe their ceremonies, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with attending conferences to learn from ministers of God who travel the world to preach the good news of Jesus and or teach truths that they believe God wants them to teach. Visiting other churches and attending conferences is good and to be encouraged, as God’s church is made up of all types and all kinds of people all over the world. However, this is not how one is ‘planted’.<br><br>

            While there is a season and place for such pursuits and phenomena, we must still belong to a church where we can call ‘home’ and have a ‘spiritual family’ supporting us in our spiritual growth and walk with God. The key is to remain in one spiritual house, for as long as the Lord requires you to be there. The other key is to seek the Lord’s leading and guidance as to which church to be planted in.<br><br>

            Regardless of where you call ‘home’, we recognise that every church and ministry, however big or small, has its God-given role in contributing to God’s will and the advancement of His Kingdom. More importantly, the concept of planting applies to all churches and it is the responsibility of each church to provide good ground that will enable good deep rooting of its members and good nourishing environment to nurture their growth, so that each plant can grow and bear fruits.<br><br>

            Some may argue that attending lots of conferences are important to receive fantastic revelational teaching and preaching which is spiritual food. While this may be true to a certain extent, conferences may provide only transient boosts of our faith, a temporary ‘hype’, a short term ‘high’. Coming out of a conference hyped up, on a high, full of joy and excitement can be described as a “sprint” event in our lifelong journey with God. Unfortunately, life is a marathon and not a sum of many sprints. It is vital for one to have a wholesome growth experience that includes other practical learning such as discipleship, serving, leadership, bible studies, relationships, amongst others, where one has the opportunity to experience the pragmatic aspect of applying Godly principles into our lives in order to bring about lasting transformation.<br><br>

            <b><font size="6">What does the process of growth look like? </font></b><br><br>
            A Christian (plant) grows from receiving the following nourishment:<br><br>

            1.	The Word of God represents food <a href="40_4_4">Matthew 4:4</a>, <a href="55_3_16">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a><br>
            2.	For it is through precept upon precept and line upon line <a href="23_28_10">Isaiah 28:10</a>, that we grow from milk for baby Christians <a href="58_5_13">Hebrews 5:13</a>, <a href="60_2_2">1 Peter 2:2</a> then progressing to solid food for mature Christians <a href="58_5_14">Hebrews 5:14</a> <br>
            3.	The Holy Spirit represents water <a href="46_12_13">1 Corinthians 12:13</a><br>
            4.	Jesus is the Word John 1:1 who sanctifies and cleanses us by washing us God’s Word <a href="49_5_26">Ephesians 5:26</a><br><br>

            When a Christian is planted, it means that he commits to staying put in the church community, and together with others, becomes willing to weather the seasons and storms of life, stick through the thick and thin of life’s adventures, challenges, difficulties and troubles. Through these experiences, we will:<br><br>

            	Learn to get along and work together with different personalities and characters<br>
            	Learn to sharpen and smoothen out rough edges with one another<br>
            	Learn to be light-hearted, gracious to let go of offences, quick to forgive and forget, overlook wrongdoings as well as develop character qualities of patience and long suffering<br>
            	Overcome seemingly impossible situations, fight to experience breakthroughs by prayer and God’s power<br>
            	Learn to serve others, extend love to the seemingly unlovable, pray for ‘enemies’, and accept strangers and foreigners<br>
            	Learn to give by allowing selfishness to give way to selflessness<br>
            	Learn to live in unity despite unique differences and while maintaining individuality<br>
            	Learn to be submissive and accountable to spiritual leaders despite differences in opinions and perspectives, by order of the Lord’s appointment<br><br>

            God wants us to grow by building long-term relationships, whether in marriage, in the church family and community, in work environments, or in the social settings. The world seems to encourage a quick fix to conflicts, otherwise a sudden clean and complete break from the relationships. Quitting as soon as conflicts arise is not God’s way at all. God is perfectly patient and perfectly long suffering. His way is to stick it out for the long haul. In fact, He planned to be the sacrifice for our sins before the world began <a href="66_13_8">Revelation 13:8</a>, some 4,000 years before He came to earth and completed His work on the cross <a href="43_19_30">John 19:30</a>. Some 2,000 years later, He is still with us today <a href="40_28_20">Matthew 28:20b</a>. He continues to walk with us through life’s journey, making us perfect in Him <a href="51_1_28">Colossians 1:28</a> and restoring our original design and glory <a href="47_3_18">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>. God does not quit on us when we are not in harmony with Him, He does not cast us out or break relationship with us. He pursues us and waits for us to respond.<br><br>

            The growth of a Christian from a seed to a seedling, into a plant, and then one day into a mighty strong oak tree, is likened to the developmental stages of humans. We start off as newborns then grow up into infants, then grow some more into toddlers, before going to primary school, then secondary school, pre-university, university and beyond. This is a long process that takes time and requires a lot of focus and attention, effort sweat and tears. There will be times that we feel like giving up, but persevering to the end will be a rewarding and fulfilling experience altogether.<br><br>

            God’s process of growing a Christian plant usually takes this form:<br><br>

            A.	The ‘<b><i>cross</i></b>’ season – Dying to self <a href="43_12_24">John 12:24</a>, surrendering to the Lordship of God <a href="43_3_30">John 3:30</a>.<br>
            B.	The ‘<b><i>honeymoon</i></b>’ season – early season of miracles, new spiritual experiences, great joy and fun through baptisms in water and the Holy Spirit.<br>
            C.	The ‘<b><i>rid the junk</i></b>’ season – Holy Spirit brings fleshly ways to surface, reveals habits that are not godly for breaking off, cleansing, washing and overcoming.<br>
            D.	The ‘<b><i>crumble the strongholds</i></b>’ season – Holy Spirit works on destroying mental and generational strongholds that prevent us from receiving the treasures of His Kingdom, our inheritances in Christ and the gifts of the Holy Spirit.<br>
            E.	The ‘<b><i>gym training</i></b>’ season – exercising spiritual disciplines of reading and memorising Scriptures daily (training the mind), experiencing the presence of God through worship, praise and expressions of gratefulness and love daily (training the spirit and bodily musical instruments), praying in known and unknown languages daily (training the tongue), walking in obedience according to the leading of the Holy Spirit daily (training the will), strengthening our spiritual senses daily (training the spiritual senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch) and dying to self daily (training to let the spirit take charge and lead our lives).<br>
            F.	The ‘<b><i>trail blazer</i></b>’ season – God starts to call and equip with gifts through prophetic words and impartation of the laying of the hands of spiritual leaders and elders, give insights into the vision and mission of His Kingdom assignment(s), ministry starts to birth by the inspiration and breath of the Holy Spirit, walking a life of signs miracles and miracles.<br><br>

            For iHeart Church, we call this process life at the “School of the Holy Spirit”, or the “Holy Spirit Boot Camp”. We believe that being planted is the foundational impetus for this growth process to kick off and be completed in every Christian. <br><br>

            Let’s be planted together because it will be worth it!
